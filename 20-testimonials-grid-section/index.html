      <h1>Daniel Clifford</h1>
      <h3>Verified Graduate</h3>  
      <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

      <h1>Jonathan Walters</h1>
      <h3>Verified Graduate</h3>
      <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated. I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.</p>

      <h1>Jeanette Harmon</h1>
      <h3>Verified Graduate</h3>
      <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress, which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.</p>

      <h1>Kira Whittle</h1>
      <h3>Verified Graduate</h3>
      <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. The entire curriculum and staff were very hands-on, and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level.</p>
